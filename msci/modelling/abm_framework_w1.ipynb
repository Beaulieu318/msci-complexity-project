    "In general we distinguish between what we call $\\textbf{bottom-up}$ approaches, in which we attempt to generate behaviour macroscopically from microscopic rules that we believe to be underlying causal influences on data sets e.g. shoppers avoid each other -> no collisions in simulations; and $\\textbf{top-down}$ approaches, in which we try to engineer patterns stochastically based on inferred patterns in the data set e.g. the average time spent in a store scales as a power law with shop area -> give agents in simulation a stochastically equivalent bias. Below we consider mainly the parameters under the $\\textbf{bottom-up}$ bracket."
